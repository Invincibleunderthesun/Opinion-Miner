0,"LG has made significant contributions to the things we've normalized today like a dedicated wide-angle camera, double tap to wake or sleep and now the shortcuts bar. Kinda miss having LG as a flagship competitor.",15K,2 months ago,
1,"Many reviewers bash the always on display for being too bright and mistaken it for still being on. I switched from android to the iPhone 14 Pro space black and in combination with the Omber leather case and the standard background with the always on display, the phone looks really gorgeous on my desk. Give it a chance to get used to!",0,4 hours ago,
2,"I’m FINALLY upgrading from my OG iPhone X lol. I ordered the 14 pro 256gb and I can’t wait for it to come in. I kept hearing how awesome the cameras are, and I do use my phone to shoot videos. I use it as a webcam. I use my phone camera A LOT, and I’m still rockin the iPhone X. Which is ancient in phone years, but honestly, this thing still runs like a champ. I changed the battery in it a couple years ago and the thing just works. So I’m hoping to get another 3 years out of the 14 pro. Not 5yrs again bc it turns out, you don’t get shit in store credit the longer you keep your phone lol.",7,1 day ago,
3,Never forget the LG V10. Honestly my favorite smartphone i've ever owned.,4,7 days ago,
4,I don't understand why they removed noise cancellation since iPhone 13.... It was such a cool feature. Every new phone instead of iPhones has that.,9,9 days ago,

6,"I honestly think the Dynamic Island is just another one of the small marketing schemes that apple does that works so well. Even though there is still a notch, this new feature made it look new for most people.",27K,2 months ago,
7,"As an avid mountaineer the satellite communication is groundbreaking. Maybe for some that feature seems like something you would never use, but I spend almost every weekend out of cell service. The ability to keep family updated with my location quickly and easily and have the ability to call for rescue is an absolute insane feature for me",542,2 months ago,
8,To me personally the true limit of the new camera is that they did not implement a 5x optical zoom. This is only partially replaced by cropping a more detailed 48mp photo but it still lacks for all those that like me don’t usually take photo of people.,535,2 months ago,
9,"Switching from a Samsung Galaxy S10e, hoping it's worth.",2,6 days ago,
10,"LG was so underrated but novel in many of their designs.  The LG V10 was a great phone. It was an absolute missed opportunity that they couldn't build off the platform.  Curve displays, multiple cameras,  notebook-like phone....LG was so creative.",454,2 months ago,
11,Will probably buy this phone in a few years when it's affordable and my current phone gets old,1,1 day ago,
12,Glad you gave LG its props. LG definitely contributed a lot of creative ways we use our smart phones!,2.9K,2 months ago,
13,"I loved the v10 with that double screen which led me survive an entire year in college without a laptop. The main screen was enormous, and as lg’s QSlide apps feature can draw applets over other apps like a window, it made the phone very dependable for serious work, especially things like calculator. It was my only device during my first year at college - all assignments, done all video editing, made reports, PPTs, designs with just that phone as I didn’t have a laptop. It was a bummer when they discontinued it after v20, I now have an iPhone 13 but it’s nowhere near how v10 used to be in fluid multitasking on a mobile device. The second screen used to intelligently show the most important apps/ functions I needed to switch, more like a companion, and if needed there was always QSlide apps to do some quick jotting or calculation without getting out of the current screen. It was like a live companion which was actually useful, I used to wonder why it disappeared when the phones became all screen.
Also worth mentioning was the desktop class files app it had which was miles ahead of the crappy files app I have on my iPhone. All my assignments and books were sorted in that phone exactly how I needed it to be.",43,2 months ago (edited),
14,"I really love the dynamic island, wish they did a sort of dynamic notch for the regular 14 because the dynamic part is purely software, but this is outstanding and i love it!",6,5 days ago,
15,"You've become my favorite phone reviewer.Aside from this, I just upgraded from my 12 Pro Max to the 14 Max, and I love it.The Dynamic Island is fun! and definitely the camera feels even better.. I've been taking more pictures than I've ever had lolThanks for a great review! :D",51,1 month ago,
16,"This certainly is not a significant upgrade from a 13 pro, or even that large from a 12 pro. As someone who is coming from a XR, I can say that the 14 pro has been a huge upgrade, even though I have had it less than 24 hours. Great video as always",284,2 months ago,
17,Got it Last October. It’s awesome,0,6 days ago,
18,It's amazing how some features like 'Car crash detection' seems so simple for people but I think this might have made the engineers and designers scratch their head to make it precise.,2.1K,2 months ago,
19,Just upgraded from my iPhone SE 2nd gen. Battery life increase is a game changer. Pro motion is a game changer. Screen size is a game changer. Camera system is a game changer. Dynamic island is neat. IPhone SE feels like the first iPhone now,14,11 days ago,
20,"Not updating this year but i absolutely love how Apple went and made something out of the Pill/hole punch. So the notch was done, new displays have hole/pill punch but instead of leaving at that  they built this cool feature. As if no one will copy it and every should copy it, such a simple idea, it's great!",21,2 months ago,
21,With the dynamic island - I'm wondering if the 'touch' will interfere with the physical sensors / cameras?  The complete omission of updates to Siri continues to surprise me.  Great review overall Markus - you make awesome content.,15,1 month ago (edited),
22,"Love the LG mention. It’s a shame that they were so slow with updates, because their hardware was always great and innovative. Thinking that they might not release a new phone ever again… I’m actually planning to buy some of them just for “collector” purposes",15,2 months ago,

24,"I really hope the dynamic island isn't copied! We've spent the last few years making selfie camera close to invisible with small holepunch cameras, and I'd hate to have a massive chunk of my screen taken up by a floating widget just because Apple did it.",1.3K,2 months ago,
25,"Dynamic island is a pretty smart solution for the notch, and allows ios a level of multitasking that is often taken for granted on Android. It makes even less sense on MacBooks but that's where this is going. If anyone remembers clippy or bonzybuddy they were interactive gui elements this is exactly that minus the annoyance.",15,2 months ago (edited),
26,"Million views pre year you been on, damn your Ludacris level consistent.  Pun intended  love the review getting it!",0,1 day ago,
27,"I did think of LG’s double screens but at the same time the dynamic island is still different. We’ve never had a marriage of software and hardware quite in this way, especially considering that this is just a combination of screen cutouts and cameras, there’s no actual screen. So I still think it’s innovative on Apple’s part.",0,1 month ago,
28,"With regards to the new phones brightness, would using Accessibility - Zoom and changing the filter to Low Light work to save battery, because the screen is way dimmer? or use more battery, because you're dimming it through a secondary means.",0,1 month ago,
29,"I mean yeah, those camera features are cool, but I have all of that on my Pixel 7 that I got for less than $500 on sale... I can tell this new iPhone will be a good phone, but man, the value proposition is just not there.",0,1 day ago,
30,Continuously impressed by the production quality standard you and your team hold yourselves to. Seriously the best tech channel on YouTube.,720,2 months ago,
31,"The satellite connectivity is not just for emergency cases.  I'm looking forward to testing it out.  I do a lot of hiking and often times will be without cellular signal for days.  I have a Garmin inReach mini that I have to pay a service fee for that lets me send texts via satellite and also send SOS in case of an actual emergency.  Thankfully I have never had to send the SOS, but the ability to update my wife and family each night that I'm OK, or if we get off schedule, etc. and send a GPS location to show we are on track is priceless and provides peace of mind. Can't wait too see if this new iPhone feature can replace the need to bring an inReach along.",6,1 month ago,
32,"great vid! one thing I’d like to touch about the always on display is that it actually adjusts to the lighting, so if you’re in a dark room the always on will be a lot dimmer and vice versa. keep up the good work though man i love it!",6,2 months ago,
33,I just upgraded from my 12 Pro Max. The Dynamic Island sold it for me. Good on Apple for making the notch useful. I picked up the new purple. It looks a lot better in person and better than the lavender. I’m throwing a case on it anyways so it’s not a big deal what color I got. The Crash Detection was another thing that sold me on this phone. I hope I’ll never have to use it but I’m glad I have it since I don’t have OnStar.,31,2 months ago (edited),
34,Always very nice review and providing explanations in simple terms for the less techies out here. Thank you.,4,1 month ago,
35,"I used to own an LG G4 as a middle schooler, and no matter how many impressive phones I see, I just can't get over how ahead of its time that phone was. Couple features that have since been introduced to iPhones are the back of the phone taps, front screen tap to wake up, always on display, default weather animations, and the ""dynamic island."" and absolutely AMAZING camera quality as well. Honestly as a South Korean myself, kinda bummed that my childhood smartphone is never coming back.",843,2 months ago (edited),
36,"I don't see anything that makes me want to go back to iOS right now. I also think the dynamic island is a short term feature. Eventually, the face id works will get smaller, they'll eventually figure out how they want to implement the under display front camera and the dynamic island will go the way of force touch after a few generations.",28,2 months ago,
37,"The car crash feature and emergency sos system is incredible. I got the 13 pro max now and as a DoorDasher this is amazing feature too hear. Upgrading next week to the 14 pro red or new color, have 13 pro max for a year now really exited for this one",3,2 months ago,
38,"I dont hate the Dynamic Island. However, I think Samsungs OneUI approach that tries to put as many controls as possible under your thumb makes more sense. I dont like having to use both hands or do an awkward gesture across the whole display just to switch something.",20,2 months ago,

40,"i like how they made IOS 16, more ""one  hand friendly"" on the lock screen. Moving notifications to the bottom.

41,"I had an LG V10 and absolutely loved that phone and the second screen.  It didn't do a whole lot in retrospect, but it felt nice to have.",2,2 months ago,
42,"I am really amazed by the Dynamic Island. You don't expect these types of upgrades between a generation. They usually develop it over time. It is working really smooth. When it comes to other brands ""trying to"" copy this feature, I don't even think it is a real problem. As you already mentioned, the internal hardware behind the Dynamic Island is one of its kind and not likely to be replicated by other brands. The only concern I am thinking about is when you touch your front camera. It might cause some problems, especially if we consider we will have to touch it a lot if we really want to take advantage of Dynamic Island. Kudos to the team behind this technology and you for making this video possible.",8,2 months ago,
43,"Based on tech notes out there they believed that Apple was going to incorporate a Wi-Fi 6E version. With previous versions the data rates were less than half of the 6E. Because of how it operates there’s a better chance to download data successfully. With the somewhat faster A16 chip, 1 TB storage, and what I thought would be the 6E Wi-Fi which is what Samsung ultra models currently have I was ready to upgrade. After learning it wasn’t in there, everything went full stop. I’ve got the same 6ax Wi-Fi in my iPhone 11 so I guess I’ll have to either get a Samsung or hope the 15 has it included.",1,2 months ago,

50,"Did anyone notice the aperture actually gets worse at  f1.78 for wide and f2.2 for ultra wide, compared to iPhone 13 Pro Max at f1.5 for wide and f1.8 for ultra wide. Isn't smaller is better in capturing low light? Did Apple purposely make it this way so that they could improve it next year?",9,2 months ago,
51,"I remember the first video I watched of Marques had this song”disarm” as the background intro. It just feels so nostalgic listening and watching this intro, Marques have been very loyal to this song. Also the birds chirping sound when the focus shifts on the “dynamic island” is just too perfect. What an amazing team to put in so much effort to provide quality content.",4,2 months ago,
52,"While the dynamic Island is a pretty clever use of dead space, I really hope it doesn't catch on as a standard thing. It's just an excuse for manufacturers to put off trying to actually solve the problem of ugly notches/cutouts in otherwise incredible displays, which I feel like we've already gotten way too comfortable with as it is. Also, while oleophobic coatings have gotten very good, inviting the user to constantly touch the camera/sensor area seems unwise, and I can definitely foresee issues and complaints arising once fingerprints begin to accumulate there.",561,2 months ago,
53,"Writing right now from an s20 and I must say, the Dynamic Island is incredible! It's such a shame that nobody found the solution for the puch hole as Apple did. For the first time, in a  long time, an Iphone comes with something that captures my attention. And yes, I had an LG V10 and V20, too bad they never imbeded that in the software so well.Let's see how competion will copy this feature moving forward since this is awesome!",4,2 months ago,
54,"the 'island' thing is actually pretty neat and i look forward to having something similar on android, preferably as a floating widget that can be moved around to either side of the phone where you can reach it. having it at the top is the worst position to reach (one-handed) but apple had to put it there because they were trying to lipstick the notch",28,2 months ago,

60,My problem is the 48 megapixel camera is only active on the main camera with no adjustments whatsoever. Once you zoom in or zoom out it defaults to the 12 megapixel. I think the 48 megapixels is going to be a lot less useful than people think.,12,2 months ago,

62,"The LG V10 and V20 had a smaller secondary screen that provided quick access to specific apps, music controls, notifications, etc.  It did what the iPhone dynamic island does.

Too bad they had flaws related to hardware and now LG doesn't make phones anymore.",443,2 months ago,
63,"The lack of physical SIM is something that I'd have to look at.  I do have to periodically travel to Guam and as a Verizon subscriber, service not available there.  Previously, I'd just arrange online prior to travel and have a SIM card waiting for me at the hotel desk when I arrive.  Will have to check to see what my options are for virtual sims to allow me to continue using my device while there.
